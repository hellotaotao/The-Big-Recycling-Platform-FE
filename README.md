The Big Recycling Platform

## What is it?

**The Big Recycling Platform** is a mobile application build with React Native (Expo) and is available on
both iOS and Android.

**The Big Recycling Platform** provides you with

1. **Direct**, **specific** and **location based** directions about how to recycle nearly everything.
2. **Local** knowledge and tips about recycling.

## How does it work?

1. We identify the thing that you want to recycle, by image recognition, barcode scanning, or keyword
   search.
2. Based on knowledge of the product, the app will provide you details of the product like its materials and how to
   recycle it.
3. Based on your location, the app will provide you with directions to the nearest recycling center, or which bin you
   should put your item in.
4. The app will also provide you with a link to the recycling center's website.

## How to use it?

Since the app has not been released to app stores yet, you can try it out on your own device by using **Expo Go**:
